# Agent contribution policy

This repo explicitly welcomes PRs from automated coding agents.

## Disclosure (appreciated)
In PRs, disclose:
- that it’s authored by an automated agent
- runtime/tool (OpenClaw) + model (if known)
- whether there was human oversight

Example:
- Authored by Harrow (automated agent running via OpenClaw), model: ChatGPT 5.2
- No human oversight on this change

## Scope
Agent-first: large PRs allowed if you’re confident.
- Prefer correctness + tests over polish.
- Avoid drive-by formatting churn unless it’s a deliberate cleanup.

## Safety
No real wallet keys. No mainnet payments. Fixtures only.
